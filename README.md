# OpenBuilder

**Open-source AI meeting assistant** — a Read AI alternative that joins your Google Meet meetings, captures live transcripts, and generates AI-powered meeting reports.

Get meeting summaries, action items, key decisions, and speaker analytics — all from your terminal.

## Features

- **Google Meet Bot** — Headless Chromium bot joins meetings, captures live captions via MutationObserver
- **AI Meeting Reports** — Post-meeting analysis with summaries, chapters, action items, decisions, and questions
- **Speaker Analytics** — Talk time, word count, and participation percentages per speaker
- **Multiple AI Providers** — Claude (Anthropic) and OpenAI supported; bring your own API key
- **Standalone Analysis** — Run `summarize` or `report` on any transcript file, not just live meetings
- **OpenClaw Skill** — Integrates as a skill for OpenClaw agents
- **Privacy-First** — Your data stays local; AI processing only happens with your own API keys

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npx openbuilder
```

This installs the OpenClaw skill and Chromium browser.

### 2. Configure AI (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Set your AI provider API key for meeting reports
npx openbuilder config set anthropicApiKey sk-ant-your-key-here
# Or use OpenAI instead
npx openbuilder config set openaiApiKey sk-your-key-here
npx openbuilder config set aiProvider openai
```

Or use environment variables:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### 3. Join a Meeting

```bash
# As a guest (host must admit)
npx openbuilder join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij --anon --bot-name "Meeting Bot"

# With Google authentication (no admission needed)
npx openbuilder auth  # one-time setup
npx openbuilder join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij --auth
```

### 4. Get Results

```bash
# View transcript
npx openbuilder transcript

# Quick AI summary
npx openbuilder summarize

# Full meeting report (summary + action items + decisions + analytics)
npx openbuilder report
```

## AI Meeting Reports

When a meeting ends (or when you run `openbuilder report`), OpenBuilder generates a structured report:

```markdown
# Meeting Report: abc-defg-hij — 2026-03-12

## Summary
The team discussed the Q1 roadmap, focusing on three main initiatives...

## Chapters
1. [14:30] Sprint Planning — Review of current sprint velocity
2. [14:42] Q1 Roadmap — Discussion of three main initiatives
3. [14:55] Resource Allocation — Team capacity and hiring plans

## Action Items
- [ ] Draft Q1 roadmap document (@Alice)
- [ ] Schedule design review for new dashboard (@Bob)
- [ ] Research caching solutions and present options (@Carol)

## Key Decisions
- Decided to prioritize the dashboard redesign over the API refactor
- Agreed to move to bi-weekly sprints starting next month

## Key Questions
- Should we invest in automated testing infrastructure? (unanswered)
- When is the design system migration complete? (answered)

## Speaker Analytics
| Speaker | Talk Time | % of Meeting | Words |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Alice   | 12:30     | 45%          | 1,850 |
| Bob     | 8:15      | 30%          | 1,200 |

```

## Configuration

### Config File

Settings are stored in `~/.openbuilder/config.json`.

```bash
# View all settings
npx openbuilder config

# Set values
npx openbuilder config set aiProvider claude
npx openbuilder config set anthropicApiKey sk-ant-...
npx openbuilder config set openaiApiKey sk-...
npx openbuilder config set botName "My Meeting Bot"
npx openbuilder config set defaultDuration 60m

# Get a value
npx openbuilder config get aiProvider

# Delete a value
npx openbuilder config delete defaultDuration
```

### Environment Variables

Environment variables override config file values:

| Variable | Config Key | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `OPENBUILDER_AI_PROVIDER` | `aiProvider` | `claude` or `openai` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `anthropicApiKey` | Anthropic API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openaiApiKey` | OpenAI API key |
| `OPENBUILDER_BOT_NAME` | `botName` | Default bot name |
| `OPENBUILDER_DEFAULT_DURATION` | `defaultDuration` | Default meeting duration |

## Authentication

The bot can join meetings in two modes:

### Guest Mode (default)
```bash
npx openbuilder join <url> --anon --bot-name "Meeting Bot"
```
The bot joins as a guest. The meeting host must admit the bot.

### Authenticated Mode
```bash
# One-time setup: sign into Google in a browser window
npx openbuilder auth

# Join as your Google account (no host admission needed)
npx openbuilder join <url> --auth
```

The auth command opens a headed Chromium browser. Sign into your Google account, then press Enter. The session is saved to `~/.openbuilder/auth.json` and reused for future joins. Re-run if the session expires.

## Standalone Transcript Analysis

OpenBuilder's AI analysis works on any transcript file in `[HH:MM:SS] Speaker: text` format — not just from live meetings:

```bash
# Summarize any transcript
npx openbuilder summarize ~/meetings/standup-2026-03-12.txt

# Full report on any transcript
npx openbuilder report ~/meetings/standup-2026-03-12.txt
```

## File Locations

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `~/.openbuilder/config.json` | Configuration file |
| `~/.openbuilder/auth.json` | Saved Google session |
| `~/.openbuilder/auth-meta.json` | Auth metadata (email, timestamp) |
| `~/.openbuilder/builder.pid` | Running bot PID |
| `~/.openclaw/workspace/openbuilder/transcripts/` | Live caption transcripts |
| `~/.openclaw/workspace/openbuilder/reports/` | AI meeting reports |

## How It Works

1. **Join**: Launches headless Chromium with stealth patches (navigator.webdriver, WebGL, plugins), navigates to the Meet URL, enters the bot name, disables camera/mic, and clicks join.

2. **Caption Capture**: Enables Google Meet's built-in live captions, then injects a MutationObserver that watches for caption DOM mutations. Speaker names are extracted from `.NWpY1d` / `.xoMHSc` badge elements. Captions are deduplicated (Meet updates word-by-word) and written to disk with timestamps.

3. **AI Analysis**: When the meeting ends, the transcript is sent to Claude or OpenAI with carefully designed prompts. Long transcripts are chunked and merged. The AI extracts summaries, chapters, action items (with assignee detection), key decisions, and key questions.

4. **Speaker Analytics**: Talk time is estimated from caption timestamps and speaking rate heuristics. Per-speaker word counts and participation percentages are calculated.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **playwright-core** (installed automatically)
- **Optional**: `@anthropic-ai/sdk` or `openai` npm package for AI features
  ```bash
  npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk  # For Claude
  npm install openai              # For OpenAI
  ```

## OpenClaw Integration

OpenBuilder ships as an OpenClaw skill. After running `npx openbuilder`, it's available to your OpenClaw agent. The agent can:

- Join meetings on your behalf
- Capture and summarize transcripts
- Generate full meeting reports
- Send screenshots to your chat

See [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) for the full agent integration guide.
